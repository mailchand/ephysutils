# ephysutils
This toolkit is a set of scripts/functions I developed based on other papers to analyse common electrophysiological indices. There are some other files from other people who have written wonderful tools to perform analysis of electrophysiological data (mainly spike trains) as well as LFP signals.

The first function I wrote estimates for a neuron the \lambda and \beta parameters described in DiCarlo and Maunsell 2005
